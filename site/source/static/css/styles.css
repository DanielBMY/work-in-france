/*

This file is the main CSS file that imports other partial CSS files (a partial is any file with an underscore `_` preceding the name).

`postcss-cli` is used to watch the main CSS file. A flat CSS file named `bundle.css` is generated as soon as a change to any partial is made. This works thanks to `postcss-import` which inline `@import` rules content. Other PostCSS plugins are used such as `postcss-cssnext`.
